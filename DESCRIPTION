Description: In Peru, subnational locations have an official geographical code, at
    different levels: Departments, Provinces and Districts. These codes are
    called UBIGEO (from the spanish denomination as "UBIcación GEOgráfica").
    The problem is that there are two widely used and not completely 
    equivalent coding systems: from INEI (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e
    Informática) and from RENIEC (REgistro Nacional de Identifación y Estado Civil). 
    This package contains datasets with the mappings from one to the other, at the 
    level of Districts, and also includes other useful information such as the
    classification in Regions and Macroregions (according to INEI and MINSA), 
    ISO-3166-2 and FIPS codes for Departments, and finally, the surface area (in Km2), 
    latitude, longitude and altitude (meters over sea level). Also included is a
    dataset with the INEI codes for the small population centers (CCPP = Centros Poblados).
